# Python package MOCCApy

## A Python-first implementation of the MOCCA project

I have been practising Python-first approach for many years now in the field of scientific computing.

Advantages:

- Python's learning curve is far less steep than that of C++ or Modern Fortran.
- Many high quality Python modules available with excellent performance. 
- multi-core and multi-process approaches possible
- can be augmented with low-level C++ code where necessary (that is in fact what all HPC Python modules do)

So it is not a performance bottleneck.

Also interesting would be to develop a Julia-first version along with it and look at performance.
